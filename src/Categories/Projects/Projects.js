The cradle features automated functions such as swinging based on room temperature, activating a small fan according to the temperature, playing a lullaby when the baby is crying, and sounding a buzzer if the baby is not in the cradle. It also includes a remote monitoring system with a live-streaming camera. My role was to design the PCB and implement the WiFi camera and live streaming app.',

The website features user-friendly navigation, an engaging layout, and is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. In addition to the development, I manage the siteâ€™s SEO to ensure better visibility on search engines, and I handle analytics to track visitor engagement and improve the site performance.
